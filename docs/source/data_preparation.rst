.. note::
    The preprocessed Astex Diverse, PoseBusters Benchmark, DockGen, and CASP15 data (available via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16791095) provide pre-holo-aligned protein structures predicted by AlphaFold 3 (and alternatively MIT-licensed ESMFold) for these respective datasets. Accordingly, users must ensure their usage of such predicted protein structures from AlphaFold 3 aligns with AlphaFold 3's Terms of Use at https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/WEIGHTS_TERMS_OF_USE.md.

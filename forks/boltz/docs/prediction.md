# Prediction

Once you have installed `boltz`, you can start making predictions by simply running:

`boltz predict <INPUT_PATH> --use_msa_server`

where `<INPUT_PATH>` is a path to the input file or a directory. The input file can either be in fasta (enough for most use cases) or YAML  format (for more complex inputs). If you specify a directory, `boltz` will run predictions on each `.yaml` or `.fasta` file in the directory. Passing the `--use_msa_server` flag will auto-generate the MSA using the mmseqs2 server, otherwise you can provide a precomputed MSA. 

The Boltz model includes an option to use inference time potentials that significantly improve the physical quality of the poses. If you find any physical issues with the model predictions, please let us know by opening an issue and including the YAML/FASTA file to replicate, the structure output and a description of the problem. If you want to run the Boltz model with the potentials you can do so with the `--use_potentials` flag. 

Before diving into more details about the input formats, here are the key differences in what they each support:

| Feature  | Fasta              | YAML    |
| -------- |--------------------| ------- |
| Polymers | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:   |
| Smiles   | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:   |
| CCD code | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:   |
| Custom MSA | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:   |
| Modified Residues | :x:                |  :white_check_mark: |
| Covalent bonds | :x:                | :white_check_mark:   |
| Pocket conditioning | :x:                | :white_check_mark:   |
| Affinity | :x:                | :white_check_mark:   |


## YAML format

The YAML format is more flexible and allows for more complex inputs, particularly around covalent bonds. The schema of the YAML is the following:

```yaml
sequences:
    - ENTITY_TYPE:
        id: CHAIN_ID 
        sequence: SEQUENCE    # only for protein, dna, rna
        smiles: 'SMILES'        # only for ligand, exclusive with ccd
        ccd: CCD              # only for ligand, exclusive with smiles
        msa: MSA_PATH         # only for protein
        modifications:
          - position: RES_IDX   # index of residue, starting from 1
            ccd: CCD            # CCD code of the modified residue
        cyclic: false
    - ENTITY_TYPE:
        id: [CHAIN_ID, CHAIN_ID]    # multiple ids in case of multiple identical entities
        ...
constraints:
    - bond:
        atom1: [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX, ATOM_NAME]
        atom2: [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX, ATOM_NAME]
    - pocket:
        binder: CHAIN_ID
        contacts: [[CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX/ATOM_NAME], [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX/ATOM_NAME]]
        max_distance: DIST_ANGSTROM
        force: false # if force is set to true (default is false), a potential will be used to enforce the pocket constraint
    - contact:
        token1: [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX/ATOM_NAME]
        token2: [CHAIN_ID, RES_IDX/ATOM_NAME]
        max_distance: DIST_ANGSTROM
        force: false # if force is set to true (default is false), a potential will be used to enforce the contact constraint

templates:
    - cif: CIF_PATH  # if only a path is provided, Boltz will find the best matchings
    - cif: CIF_PATH
      force: true # optional, if force is set to true (default is false), a potential will be used to enforce the template
      threshold: DISTANCE_THRESHOLD # optional, controls the distance (in Angstroms) that the prediction can deviate from the template
    - cif: CIF_PATH
      chain_id: CHAIN_ID   # optional, specify which chain to find a template for
    - cif: CIF_PATH
      chain_id: [CHAIN_ID, CHAIN_ID]  # can be more than one
      template_id: [TEMPLATE_CHAIN_ID, TEMPLATE_CHAIN_ID]
properties:
    - affinity:
        binder: CHAIN_ID

```

`sequences` has one entry for every unique chain/molecule in the input. Each polymer entity as a `ENTITY_TYPE`  either `protein`, `dna` or `rna` and have a `sequence` attribute. Non-polymer entities are indicated by `ENTITY_TYPE` equal to `ligand` and have a `smiles` or `ccd` attribute. `CHAIN_ID` is the unique identifier for each chain/molecule, and it should be set as a list in case of multiple identical entities in the structure. For proteins, the `msa` key is required by default but can be omitted by passing the `--use_msa_server` flag which will auto-generate the MSA using the mmseqs2 server. If you wish to use a precomputed MSA, use the `msa` attribute with `MSA_PATH` indicating the path to the `.a3m` file containing the MSA for that protein. If you wish to explicitly run single sequence mode (which is generally advised against as it will hurt model performance), you may do so by using the special keyword `empty` for that protein (ex: `msa: empty`). For custom MSA, you may wish to indicate pairing keys to the model. You can do so by using a CSV format instead of a3m with two columns: `sequence` with the protein sequences and `key` which is a unique identifier indicating matching rows across CSV files of each protein chain.

The `modifications` field is an optional field that allows you to specify modified residues in the polymer (`protein`, `dna` or`rna`). The `position` field specifies the index (starting from 1) of the residue, and `ccd` is the CCD code of the modified residue. This field is currently only supported for CCD ligands. The `cyclic` flag should be used to specify polymer chains (not ligands) that are cyclic. 

`constraints` is an optional field that allows you to specify additional information about the input structure. 


* The `bond` constraint specifies covalent bonds between two atoms (`atom1` and `atom2`). It is currently only supported for CCD ligands and canonical residues, `CHAIN_ID` refers to the id of the residue set above, `RES_IDX` is the index (starting from 1) of the residue (1 for ligands), and `ATOM_NAME` is the standardized atom name (can be verified in CIF file of that component on the RCSB website).

* The `pocket` constraint specifies the residues associated with a ligand, where `binder` refers to the chain binding to the pocket (which can be a molecule, protein, DNA or RNA) and `contacts` is the list of chain and residue indices (starting from 1) associated with the pocket. The model currently only supports the specification of a single `binder` chain (and any number of `contacts` residues in other chains).

`templates` is an optional field that allows you to specify structural templates for your prediction. At minimum, you must provide the path to the structural template, which must provided as a CIF file. If you wish to explicitly define which of the chains in your YAML should be templated using this CIF file, you can use the `chain_id` entry to specify them. Whether a set of ids is provided or not, Boltz will find the best matching chains from the provided template. If you wish to explicitly define the mapping yourself, you may provide the corresponding template_id. Note that only protein chains can be templated.

`properties` is an optional field that allows you to specify whether you want to compute the affinity. If enabled, you must also provide the chain_id corresponding to the small molecule against which the affinity will be computed. Only one single molecule can be specified for affinity computation, and it must be a ligand chain (not a protein, DNA or RNA).

As an example:

```yaml
version: 1
sequences:
  - protein:
      id: [A, B]
      sequence: MVTPEGNVSLVDESLLVGVTDEDRAVRSAHQFYERLIGLWAPAVMEAAHELGVFAALAEAPADSGELARRLDCDARAMRVLLDALYAYDVIDRIHDTNGFRYLLSAEARECLLPGTLFSLVGKFMHDINVAWPAWRNLAEVVRHGARDTSGAESPNGIAQEDYESLVGGINFWAPPIVTTLSRKLRASGRSGDATASVLDVGCGTGLYSQLLLREFPRWTATGLDVERIATLANAQALRLGVEERFATRAGDFWRGGWGTGYDLVLFANIFHLQTPASAVRLMRHAAACLAPDGLVAVVDQIVDADREPKTPQDRFALLFAASMTNTGGGDAYTFQEYEEWFTAAGLQRIETLDTPMHRILLARRATEPSAVPEGQASENLYFQ
      msa: ./examples/msa/seq1.a3m
  - ligand:
      id: [C, D]
      ccd: SAH
  - ligand:
      id: [E, F]
      smiles: 'N[C@@H](Cc1ccc(O)cc1)C(=O)O'
```


## Fasta format

The fasta format is a little simpler, and should contain entries as follows:

```
>CHAIN_ID|ENTITY_TYPE|MSA_PATH
SEQUENCE
```

The `CHAIN_ID` is a unique identifier for each input chain. The `ENTITY_TYPE` can be one of `protein`, `dna`, `rna`, `smiles`, `ccd` (note that we support both smiles and CCD code for ligands). The `MSA_PATH` is only applicable to proteins. By default, MSA's are required, but they can be omited by passing the `--use_msa_server` flag which will auto-generate the MSA using the mmseqs2 server. If you wish to use a custom MSA, use it to set the path to the `.a3m` file containing a pre-computed MSA for this protein. If you wish to explicitly run single sequence mode (which is generally advised against as it will hurt model performance), you may do so by using the special keyword `empty` for that protein (ex: `>A|protein|empty`). For custom MSA, you may wish to indicate pairing keys to the model. You can do so by using a CSV format instead of a3m with two columns: `sequence` with the protein sequences and `key` which is a unique identifier indicating matching rows across CSV files of each protein chain.

For each of these cases, the corresponding `SEQUENCE` will contain an amino acid sequence (e.g. `EFKEAFSLF`), a sequence of nucleotide bases (e.g. `ATCG`), a smiles string (e.g. `CC1=CC=CC=C1`), or a CCD code (e.g. `ATP`), depending on the entity.

## Options

The following options are available for the `predict` command:

    boltz predict input_path [OPTIONS]

As an example, to predict a structure using 10 recycling steps and 25 samples (the default parameters for AlphaFold3) use:

    boltz predict input_path --recycling_steps 10 --diffusion_samples 25

(note however that the prediction will take significantly longer)

## Output

After running the model, the generated outputs are organized into the output directory following the structure below:
```
out_dir/
├── lightning_logs/                                            # Logs generated during training or evaluation

```
The `predictions` folder contains a unique folder for each input file. The input folders contain `diffusion_samples` predictions saved in the output_format ordered by confidence score as well as additional files containing the predictions of the confidence model and affinity model. The `processed` folder contains the processed input files that are used by the model during inference.

The output confidence `.json` file contains various aggregated confidence scores for specific sample. The structure of the file is as follows:
```yaml
{
    "confidence_score": 0.8367,       # Aggregated score used to sort the predictions, corresponds to 0.8 * complex_plddt + 0.2 * iptm (ptm for single chains)
    "ptm": 0.8425,                    # Predicted TM score for the complex
    "iptm": 0.8225,                   # Predicted TM score when aggregating at the interfaces
    "ligand_iptm": 0.0,               # ipTM but only aggregating at protein-ligand interfaces
    "protein_iptm": 0.8225,           # ipTM but only aggregating at protein-protein interfaces
    "complex_plddt": 0.8402,          # Average pLDDT score for the complex
    "complex_iplddt": 0.8241,         # Average pLDDT score when upweighting interface tokens
    "complex_pde": 0.8912,            # Average PDE score for the complex
    "complex_ipde": 5.1650,           # Average PDE score when aggregating at interfaces  
    "chains_ptm": {                   # Predicted TM score within each chain
        "0": 0.8533,
        "1": 0.8330
    },
    "pair_chains_iptm": {             # Predicted (interface) TM score between each pair of chains
        "0": {
            "0": 0.8533,
            "1": 0.8090
        },
        "1": {
            "0": 0.8225,
            "1": 0.8330
        }
    }
}
```
`confidence_score`, `ptm` and `plddt` scores (and their interface and individual chain analogues) have a range of [0, 1], where higher values indicate higher confidence. `pde` scores have a unit of angstroms, where lower values indicate higher confidence.

The output affinity `.json` file is organized as follows:
```yaml
{
    "affinity_pred_value": 0.8367,             # Predicted binding affinity from the ensemble model
    "affinity_probability_binary": 0.8425,     # Predicted binding likelihood from the ensemble model
    "affinity_pred_value1": 0.8225,            # Predicted binding affinity from the first model of the ensemble
    "affinity_probability_binary1": 0.0,       # Predicted binding likelihood from the first model in the ensemble
    "affinity_pred_value2": 0.8225,            # Predicted binding affinity from the second model of the ensemble
    "affinity_probability_binary2": 0.8402,    # Predicted binding likelihood from the second model in the ensemble
}
```

There are two main predictions in the affinity output: `affinity_pred_value` and `affinity_probability_binary`. They are trained on largely different datasets, with different supervisions, and should be used in different contexts. 

The `affinity_probability_binary` field should be used to detect binders from decoys, for example in a hit-discovery stage. It's value ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the predicted probability that the ligand is a binder.

The `affinity_pred_value` aims to measure the specific affinity of different binders and how this changes with small modifications of the molecule. This should be used in ligand optimization stages such as hit-to-lead and lead-optimization. It reports a binding affinity value as `log(IC50)`, derived from an `IC50` measured in `μM`. Lower values indicate stronger predicted binding, for instance:
- IC50 of $10^{-9}$ M $\longrightarrow$ our model outputs $-3$ (strong binder)
- IC50 of $10^{-6}$ M $\longrightarrow$ our model outputs $0$ (moderate binder)
- IC50 of $10^{-4}$ M $\longrightarrow$ our model outputs $2$ (weak binder / decoy)

You can convert the model's output to pIC50 in `kcal/mol` by using `y --> (6 - y) * 1.364` where `y` is the model's prediction.


## Authentication to MSA Server

When using the `--use_msa_server` option with a server that requires authentication, you can provide credentials in one of two ways:

### 1. Basic Authentication

- Use the CLI options `--msa_server_username` and `--msa_server_password`.
- Or, set the environment variables:
  - `BOLTZ_MSA_USERNAME` (for the username)
  - `BOLTZ_MSA_PASSWORD` (for the password, recommended for security)

**Example:**
```bash
export BOLTZ_MSA_USERNAME=myuser
export BOLTZ_MSA_PASSWORD=mypassword
boltz predict ... --use_msa_server
```
Or:
```bash
boltz predict ... --use_msa_server --msa_server_username myuser --msa_server_password mypassword
```

### 2. API Key Authentication

- Use the CLI options `--api_key_header` (default: `X-API-Key`) and `--api_key_value` to specify the header and value for API key authentication.
- Or, set the API key value via the environment variable `MSA_API_KEY_VALUE` (recommended for security).

**Example using CLI:**
```bash
boltz predict ... --use_msa_server --api_key_header X-API-Key --api_key_value <your-api-key>
```

**Example using environment variable:**
```bash
export MSA_API_KEY_VALUE=<your-api-key>
boltz predict ... --use_msa_server --api_key_header X-API-Key
```
If both the CLI option and environment variable are set, the CLI option takes precedence.

> If your server expects a different header, set `--api_key_header` accordingly (e.g., `--api_key_header X-Gravitee-Api-Key`).

---

**Note:**  
Only one authentication method (basic or API key) can be used at a time. If both are provided, the program will raise an error.


## Troubleshooting

 - When running on old NVIDIA GPUs, you may encounter an error related to the `cuequivariance` library. In this case, you should run the model with the `--no_kernels` flag, which will disable the use of the `cuequivariance` library and allow the model to run without it. This may result in slightly lower performance, but it will allow you to run the model on older hardware.
